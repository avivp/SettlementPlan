# SettlementPlan
Tool for settling expenses between friends or roommates. 
Can be used to settle expenses at the end of a trip or apartment rent fees.

 - Create a settlement plan
 - Add participants
 - Add charges between participants. 
A charge does not have to include all participants in the plan. 
A charge should specify the expense distribution over the participants involved (e..g how much each participant should pay).
A relative expense distribution (using prcentage) is not supported.
 - When done, get a summary of debts between participants.
